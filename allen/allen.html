		For almost 8 years, I served in the US Navy as an Electronics Technician, Surface Warfare Specialist.  After graduating Electronics Technician "A" School at the top of my class with honors, I spent four months onboard the USS David R. Ray before my orders were changed due to her impending de-commissioning.  I spent the next 3 1/2 years onboard the USS Abraham Lincoln including the 10 months of her extended deployment to the Persian Gulf where we participated in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.  While onboard the Lincoln, our second child was born--Michael.  I finished my tour of duty as a Naval Instructor at Electronics Technician "A" School onboard Center for Surface Combat Systems Great Lakes.  I separated from active duty in 2007 as a First Class Petty Officer.

		After leaving the service, I worked as a police dispatcher for about a year.  Currently, I'm an intern with SC Johnson's IT department and I'm attending University of Wisconsin to finish my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.  I grew up alongside the computer and have always been attracted to computers and computing.  I'm told that my parents used to take me with them to video arcades before I was even able to sit up by myself in my stroller.  When I was a kid, we couldn't afford a computer, so I would check out library books on programming, write my own programs on notebook paper, and then debug them in my head!  It's true--I love computers.  I do like computer games, my favorite being Quake III: Arena (hop on my server if you're ready to have your butt rail launched through the air, pummel cratered, and then handed back to you!), but that's only one aspect.  I love computers--setting them up, upgrading them, using them, fixing them, programming them--I love every aspect of computers.  You know those guys that go outside, pop the hood of their car and start tweaking and poking around if they get bored?  That's me with computers; I've been known to pop open the case and just start poking around for no real reason.  And while I have changed course professionally (several times actually), I still enjoy making and listening to music.  I can still play guitar and with a little practice could re-learn piano and clarinet.  I'm also beginning to dabble a bit in digital music.  MIDI, sequencing, mixing, recording--that kind of stuff.

	Where does the time go?  Well, I've done a small update to the page, but not much and I won't have time to do much else for the forseeable future.  Classes start up again on the 22nd and that will pretty much take over my life until May when my...OH YEAH!  That's the news!<br />
	I got picked up for the internship with SC Johnson's IT dept.  I'm so excited to get started there; the only bad thing is that I have to wait until May for it to start.
	<p class="news">January 28th, 2006<br />
	Well, my computer's all went hay wire for a bit there but, things are back up and running.  My server is awesome and I hope to have this converted to a blog style section before long.  I'm working 13-14 hours a day now so, it's really hard to get anything done with stuff at home but, I've picked up enough cool technology that I can work on stuff when I get a chance at work.</p>
