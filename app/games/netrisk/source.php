<h1>Source Code</h1>
<p>This is the latest bug fix or feature addition merited important enough for a new
source file to be built. It won't be compatible with a database from the original
sourceforge netrisk without a lot of hand-editing of the database, due to the
permanent users addition. Install.php also <em>will not</em> work.</p>
